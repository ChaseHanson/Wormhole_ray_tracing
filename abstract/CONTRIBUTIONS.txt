For the majority of this project, all three members worked on a Zoom call and
(despite what the commit history might suggest) there was synchronous collaboration.

All group members collaborated to build initial functionality with initial conditions and integration.
L.R.W. streamlined the code and implemented the image processing to warp the input images after interpolating
the map. Q.M.W and C.J.H researched possible solutions and performed analysis to solve a major tabulation and
interpolation error with the initial build. Q.M.W and C.J.H hacked the solution individually, and L.R.W
implemented the final fix.
