Through the wormhole: using ray-tracing to visualize the wormhole of Interstellar.

Chase Hanson, Quinn White, Lily Whitler

A wormhole is a theoretical object that connects two different points in spacetime, and while these objects have not
been observed in our universe, using the equations of general relativity and the method of ray-tracing, we can
visualize their effects on spacetime. Following the methods of James et al. (2015), the geodesic equation was
numerically integrated using RK45, and incident rays of light were followed back through or around the wormhole
to their origins in spacetime. From a discrete grid, the traced rays were interpolated based on which side of
the wormhole the rays originated to build an image for the observer. We present these images for varying wormhole
lengths and lensing widths to recreate visuals from James et al. Future work would involve parallelization of the
ray-tracing algorithm, improving the resolution of the lensed images, and generating a moving picture.
